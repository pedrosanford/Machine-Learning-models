## Repository Structure

This repository is organized by machine learning paradigm to keep models, experiments, and notes easy to navigate and scale.

📁 **supervised/**  
Models trained on labeled data.  
Examples include:
- Linear & Logistic Regression  
- Decision Trees, Random Forests  
- Gradient Boosting (XGBoost, LightGBM)  
- Classification and regression problems  

📁 **unsupervised/**  
Models that discover patterns in unlabeled data.  
Examples include:
- K-Means, Hierarchical Clustering  
- DBSCAN  
- PCA and other dimensionality reduction techniques  

📁 **semi-supervised/**  
Approaches that combine a small amount of labeled data with a large amount of unlabeled data.  
Examples include:
- Self-training methods  
- Label propagation  
- Hybrid supervised–unsupervised pipelines  

Each folder may contain datasets, notebooks, source code, and trained models related to that learning approach.
